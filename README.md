    There is a need to redefine the status of women in the society. A change can be brought through the constitution and
supportive legislations. The Constitution of India gives a women status equal to men. Women empowerment has to
begin with women's active participation. Unless women throw off the shackles that ignore their talent, skill and spirit women through education and economic self-reliance, women cannot be empowered.<br><br>
    According to READ GLOBAL one of the key enablers for women empowerment is the need for a “safe space” for
women to gather and learn. However, as of now there is no such virtual platform available. The next enabler for women
empowerment is to teach women job skills and seed businesses. There is also a need to build their self-esteem and
confidence. With EMPOWER we propose a platform for women to build, grow and learn together. We aim to create
communities of women that support each other along with the skill enhancement and upliftment provided to them by
NGOs on the platform. We aim to curate a platform where women can connect, share their thoughts, promote their businesses, connect with potential recruiters and get quick replies to common questions through conversational AI.
